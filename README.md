# Frequently Asked Questions chatbot

I developed a FAQ chatbot, designed to automate customer support by addressing commonly asked questions independently.
The administrator can create the chatbot's database by uploading PDF files, allowing clients to search for answers within the PDF content.
If a question is not covered by the uploaded PDFs, the chatbot can utilize OpenAI services to provide an answer.

Backend: Node.js(Express), MongoDB, PDF-Parse, OpenAI(GPT4), Langchain, Pinecone.

Frontend: React
